    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE)
      router. Specifically, the current version of this document focuses on
      the basic provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning of IPv6
      hosts attached to it. The document obsoletes RFC 7084.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines basic IPv6 features for a residential or small-
         office router, referred to as an "IPv6 CE router", in order to
         establish an industry baseline for features to be implemented on such
         a router.
      </t>
      <t>These routers typically also support IPv4.
      </t>

      <t>Mixed environments of dual-stack hosts and IPv6-only hosts (behind
      the CE router) can be more complex if the IPv6-only devices are using a
      translator to access IPv4 servers <xref target="RFC6144"></xref>.
      Support for such mixed environments is not in scope of this
      document.</t>

      <t>This document specifies how an IPv6 CE router automatically
      provisions its WAN interface, acquires address space for provisioning of
      its LAN interfaces, and fetches other configuration information from the
      service provider network. Automatic provisioning of more complex
      topology than a single router with multiple LAN interfaces is out of
      scope for this document.</t>

      <t>See <xref target="RFC4779"></xref> for a discussion of options
      available for deploying IPv6 in service provider access networks.</t>

      <t>The document does not cover the IP transition technologies available 
      to IPv6 CE Router.  For information about IP transition technologies 
      please refer to <xref target="RFC8585"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
           Take careful note: Unlike other IETF documents, the key words "MUST",
           "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
           "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are not used as
           described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>. This document uses 
           these keywords not
           strictly for the purpose of interoperability, but rather for the
           purpose of establishing industry-common baseline functionality.  As
           such, the document points to several other specifications (preferable
           in RFC or stable form) to provide additional guidance to implementers
           regarding any protocol implementation required to produce a
           successful CE router that interoperates successfully with a
           particular subset of currently deploying and planned common IPv6
           access networks.

    <section title="Architecture">
      <section title="Current IPv4 End-User Network Architecture">
        <t>An end-user network will likely support both IPv4 and IPv6. It is
        not expected that an end user will change their existing network
        topology with the introduction of IPv6. There are some differences in
        how IPv6 works and is provisioned; these differences have implications
        for the network architecture. A typical IPv4 end-user network consists
        of a "plug and play" router with NAT functionality and a single link
        behind it, connected to the service provider network.</t>

        <t>A typical IPv4 NAT deployment by default blocks all incoming
        connections. Opening of ports is typically allowed using a Universal
        Plug and Play Internet Gateway Device (UPnP IGD) <xref
        target="UPnP-IGD"></xref> or some other firewall control protocol.</t>

        <t>Another consequence of using private address space in the end-user
        network is that it provides stable addressing; that is, it never changes
        even when you change service providers, and the addresses are always
        there even when the WAN interface is down or the customer edge router
        has not yet been provisioned.</t>

        <t>Many existing routers support dynamic routing (which learns routes 
           from other routers), and advanced end-users can build arbitrary, complex 
           networks using manual configuration of address prefixes combined with a 
           dynamic routing protocol.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="IPv6 End-User Network Architecture">
        <t>The end-user network architecture for IPv6 should provide
        equivalent or better capabilities and functionality than the current
        IPv4 architecture.</t>

        <t>The end-user network is a stub network. Figure 1 illustrates the
        model topology for the end-user network.</t>

        <t>For IPv6 multicast traffic, the IPv6 CE router may act as a
        Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) proxy <xref
        target="RFC4605"></xref> and may support a dynamic multicast routing
        protocol.</t>

        <t>The IPv6 CE router may be manually configured in an arbitrary
        topology with a dynamic routing protocol. Automatic provisioning and
        configuration are described for a single IPv6 CE router only.</t>

        <section title="Local Communication">
          <t>Link-local IPv6 addresses are used by hosts communicating on a single
  link.  Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses (ULAs) <xref target="RFC4193" /> are used
  by hosts communicating within the end-user network across multiple
  links, but without requiring the application to use a globally
  routable address.  The IPv6 CE router defaults to acting as the
  demarcation point between two networks by providing a ULA boundary, a
  multicast zone boundary, and ingress and egress traffic filters.</t>

          <t>At the time of this writing, several host implementations do not
          handle the case where they have an IPv6 address configured and no
          IPv6 connectivity, either because the address itself has a limited
          topological reachability (e.g., ULA) or because the IPv6 CE router
          is not connected to the IPv6 network on its WAN interface. To
          support host implementations that do not handle multihoming in a
          multi-prefix environment <xref target="RFC7157"></xref>, the IPv6 CE router should
          not, as detailed in the requirements below, advertise itself as a
          default router on the LAN interface(s) when it does not have IPv6
          connectivity on the WAN interface or when it is not provisioned with
          IPv6 addresses. For local IPv6 communication, the mechanisms
          specified in <xref target="RFC4191"></xref> are used.</t>

          <t>ULA addressing is useful where the IPv6 CE router has multiple
          LAN interfaces with hosts that need to communicate with each other.
          If the IPv6 CE router has only a single LAN interface (IPv6 link),
          then link-local addressing can be used instead.</t>

          <t>Coexistence with IPv4 requires any IPv6 CE router(s) on the LAN
          to conform to these recommendations, especially requirements ULA-5
          and L-4 below.</t>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <section title="General Requirements">
        <t>The IPv6 CE router is responsible for implementing IPv6 routing;
        that is, the IPv6 CE router must look up the IPv6 destination address
        in its routing table to decide to which interface it should send the
        packet.</t>

        <t>In this role, the IPv6 CE router is responsible for ensuring that
        traffic using its ULA addressing does not go out the WAN interface
        and does not originate from the WAN interface.</t>

        <t><list style="format G-%d:">
            <t>An IPv6 CE router is an IPv6 node according to the <xref
            target="RFC8504"> IPv6 Node Requirements specification</xref>.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST implement ICMPv6 according to <xref
            target="RFC4443"></xref>. In particular, point-to-point links MUST
            be handled as described in Section 3.1 of <xref
            target="RFC4443"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST NOT forward any IPv6 traffic between
            its LAN interface(s) and its WAN interface until the router has
            successfully completed the IPv6 address and the delegated prefix
            acquisition process.</t>

            <t>By default, an IPv6 CE router that has no default router(s) on
            its WAN interface MUST NOT advertise itself as an IPv6 default
            router on its LAN interfaces. That is, the "Router Lifetime" field
            is set to zero in all Router Advertisement messages it originates
            <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>

            <t>By default, if the IPv6 CE router is an advertising router and
            loses its IPv6 default router(s) and/or detects loss of
            connectivity on the WAN interface, it MUST explicitly invalidate
            itself as an IPv6 default router on each of its advertising
            interfaces by immediately transmitting one or more Router
            Advertisement messages with the "Router Lifetime" field set to
            zero <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>.</t>
          </list></t>

      <section title="WAN-Side Configuration">
        <t>The IPv6 CE router will need to support connectivity to one or more
        access network architectures. This document describes an IPv6 CE
        router that is not specific to any particular architecture or service
        provider and that supports all commonly used architectures.</t>

        <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and DHCPv6 protocols operate over any type
        of IPv6-supported link layer, and there is no need for a
        link-layer-specific configuration protocol for IPv6 network-layer
        configuration options as in, e.g., PPP IP Control Protocol (IPCP) for
        IPv4. This section makes the assumption that the same mechanism will
        work for any link layer, be it Ethernet, the Data Over Cable Service
        Interface Specification (DOCSIS), PPP, or others.</t>

        <t>WAN-side requirements: <list style="format W-%d:">
            <t>When the router is attached to the WAN interface link, it MUST
            act as an IPv6 host for the purposes of stateless <xref
            target="RFC4862"></xref> or stateful <xref
            target="RFC8415"></xref> interface address assignment.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST generate a link-local address and
            finish Duplicate Address Detection according to <xref
            target="RFC4862"></xref> prior to sending any Router Solicitations
            on the interface. The source address used in the subsequent Router
            Solicitation MUST be the link-local address on the WAN
            interface.</t>

            <t>Absent other routing information, the IPv6 CE router MUST use
            Router Discovery as specified in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> to
            discover a default router(s) and install a default route(s) in its
            routing table with the discovered router's address as the next
            hop.</t>

            <t>The router MUST act as a requesting router for the purposes of
            DHCPv6 prefix delegation (<xref target="RFC8415"></xref>).</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST use a persistent DHCP Unique Identifier
            (DUID) for DHCPv6 messages. The DUID MUST NOT change between
            network-interface resets or IPv6 CE router reboots.</t>

            <t>The WAN interface of the CE router SHOULD support a Port Control Protocol (PCP) client
            as specified in <xref target="RFC6887"></xref> for use
            by applications on the CE router. The PCP client SHOULD follow the
            procedure specified in Section 8.1 of <xref
            target="RFC6887"></xref> to discover its PCP server.
            This document takes no position on whether such functionality is
            enabled by default or mechanisms by which users would configure
            the functionality. Handling PCP requests from PCP clients in the
            LAN side of the CE router is out of scope.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD implement the Network Time
            Protocol (NTP) as specified in <xref target="RFC5905"></xref> to provide 
            a time reference common to the service provider for other protocols, such 
            as DHCPv6, to use.  If the CE router implements NTP, it requests the NTP 
            Server DHCPv6 option <xref target="RFC5908"></xref> and uses the received 
            list of servers as primary time reference, unless explicitly configured
            otherwise. LAN side support of NTP is out of scope for this document.</t>

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router receives a Router Advertisement message
            (described in <xref target="RFC4861"></xref>) with the M flag set
            to 1, the IPv6 CE router MUST do DHCPv6 address assignment
            (request an IA_NA option).</t>

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router does not acquire a global IPv6 address(es)
            from either SLAAC or DHCPv6, then it MUST create a global IPv6
            address(es) from its delegated prefix(es) and configure those on
            one of its internal virtual network interfaces, unless configured
            to require a global IPv6 address on the WAN interface.</t>

            <t>The CE router MUST support the SOL_MAX_RT 
               option <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>
               and request the SOL_MAX_RT option in an Option Request Option (ORO).</t>

            <t>As a router, the IPv6 CE router MUST follow the weak host (Weak
            End System) model <xref target="RFC1122"></xref>. When originating packets
            from an interface, it will use a source address from another one
            of its interfaces if the outgoing interface does not have an
            address of suitable scope.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router SHOULD implement the Information Refresh
            Time option and associated client behavior as specified in <xref
            target="RFC8415"></xref>.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE Router MUST NOT use an EUI-64 based address as 
            discussed in <xref target="RFC7721"></xref>. IPv6 CE Router SHOULD follow
            <xref target="RFC8064"></xref> when generating an IPv6 address.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Prefix delegation requirements: <list style="format WPD-%d:">
            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST support DHCPv6 prefix delegation
            requesting router behavior as specified in <xref
            target="RFC8415"></xref> (Identity Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) option).</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MAY indicate as a hint to the delegating
            router the size of the prefix it requires. If so, it MUST ask for
            a prefix large enough to assign one /64 for each of its
            interfaces, rounded up to the nearest nibble, and SHOULD be
            configurable to ask for more.</t>

            <t>The IPv6 CE router MUST be prepared to accept a delegated
            prefix size different from what is given in the hint. If the
            delegated prefix is too small to address all of its interfaces,
            the IPv6 CE router SHOULD log a system management error. <xref
            target="RFC6177"></xref> covers the recommendations for service
            providers for prefix allocation sizes.</t>

            <t>By default, the IPv6 CE router MUST initiate DHCPv6 prefix
            delegation when either the M or O flags are set to 1 in a received
            Router Advertisement (RA) message.  Behavior of the CE router to 
            use DHCPv6 prefix delegation when the CE router has not received 
            any RA or received an RA with the M and the O bits set to zero is 
            out of scope for this document.</t>

            <t>Any packet received by the CE router with a destination
               address in the prefix(es) delegated to the CE router but
               not in the set of prefixes assigned by the CE router to the
               LAN must be dropped.  In other words, the next hop for the
               prefix(es) delegated to the CE router should be the null
               destination.  This is necessary to prevent forwarding loops
               when some addresses covered by the aggregate are not
               reachable <xref target="RFC4632"></xref>.<list
                style="format (%c)">

            <t>If the IPv6 CE router requests both an IA_NA and an IA_PD
            option in DHCPv6, it MUST accept an IA_PD option in DHCPv6
            Advertise/Reply messages, even if the message does not contain any
            addresses, unless configured to only obtain its WAN IPv6 address
            via DHCPv6; see <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations">
        <t>It is considered a best practice to filter obviously malicious

        filters. The CE router is also expected to offer mechanisms to filter
        traffic entering the customer network; however, the method by which
        vendors implement configurable packet filtering is beyond the scope of
        this document.</t>
